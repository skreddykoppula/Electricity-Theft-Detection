# An Efficient Approach for Electricity Theft Detection in Smart Grids

Power systems throughout the world are at serious 
risk from electricity theft, which can lead to large financial 
losses. This paper presents a novel approach to analyze 
electricity consumption data using deep learning, specifically 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The research employs a 
State Grid Corporation of China dataset and integrates timedomain and frequency-domain data to suggest a novel Deep 
Neural Network (DNN) classification technique that 
considerably improves theft detection precision. The study 
maximizes feature space and highlights the significance of 
frequency-domain features by utilizing methods such as 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum 
Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The Adam 
optimizer and a Bayesian optimizer are used in the model 
optimization process to adjust the hyperparameters. This study 
makes a significant contribution to solving the urgent global 
problem of electricity theft.
